# Shopshare

The purpose of this project is to build a website named “Shopshare” in which people can share
with each other their experience with the items they purchased before. 

People often have trouble looking for a real, qualified, informative item review when they do not know which item is better
for them. 

Especially with the growth of e-commerce today, a comprehensive view offered on an
item is especially useful for customers. 

Also, this platform should encourage people to build trusted online “customerships” with each other to maximize an individual’s shopping experience
by taking advantage of each other’s shopping experience.

*Sample customer data is added to the database
